# Tasks

This is not comprehensive. I'm in the midst of a new-project flurry of doing a million tasks, so this list is going to be missing items for sure. Ranked in terms of priority, from highest to lowest priority, this is the set of tasks I'll be working in upcoming contributions:

- Add unit tests
- Update README
- Pull in test ROMs (this might change how the logger needs to work, depending on how the validation for the test ROMs work)
- Add a scanline renderer in opengl
  - can this be done with a triangle strip?
- Doxygen generation
- Add a conf file that controls
  - window size
  - controller mappings + hotkeys
  - log level
- Figure out how to actually produce a debug build and make conan's dependencies still resolve correctly
- Support windows and mac builds
