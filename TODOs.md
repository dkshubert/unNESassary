# Tasks

This is not comprehensive. I'm in the midst of a new-project flurry of doing a million tasks, so this list is going to be missing items for sure. Ranked in terms of priority, from highest to lowest:

- Update clock tick handler to include the tick id as a param
- Add a logger interface, with a stdout implementation
- Add clang-format
- Add unit tests
- Pull in test ROMs (this might change how the logger needs to work, depending on how the validation for the test ROMs work)
- Add a scanline renderer in opengl
- Add a conf file that controls
  - window size
  - controller mappings + hotkeys
  - log level
- Figure out how to actually produce a debug build and make conan's dependencies still resolve correctly
- Support windows and mac builds
