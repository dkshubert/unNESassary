# Design Notes

The subfolders in this "emulator" directory each represent the distinct physical objects that a gamer would interact with. Specifically, a gamer puts a `cartridge` in an `nes` system, and turns on the `tv`, which align with the folders in this directory. There's a bit of a philisophical question whether or not the cartridge is part of the NES system itself when it's plugged in, especially considering that the cartridge does things like extend the RAM in the NES. Since the NES and cartridge are designed to be physically separated, however, I decided to separate their source files into separate folders, to as closely draw boundaries to the real world as possible.
